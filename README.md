# SIO187-COVID19-Analysis
Final project for Marine Biology Statistics at UCSD

This project was for my Marine Biology statistics course at UCSD (SIO187) where we learned to use R and Rstudio to analyze data sets. I chose to do my analysis on COVID19 cases and their progresssion with respect to how the county voted in the 2016 election. The data is based on 2 available sets:
1) https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
2) https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-16

First project in R :)
